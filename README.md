This study applied Bayesian Logistic Regression (BLR) and Multilevel Intercept Model (MIM) using BRMS to predict diabetes from BRFSS data. The MIM achieved 75.3% accuracy, identifying Age, BMI, GenHlth, and Cholesterol as key predictors. Bayesian methods proved robust for probabilistic health risk prediction.

This project focused on predicting diabetes risk using advanced Bayesian data analysis techniques applied to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. The study implemented two key models, Bayesian Logistic Regression (BLR) and a Multilevel Intercept Model (MIM), utilizing the BRMS package in R, which leverages Stan for efficient sampling and parameter estimation.

A variety of priors, including Normal(0,1), Cauchy(0,3), and Logistic(0,3), were examined to assess their influence on posterior estimates. Through model comparison based on Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV) and Expected Log Predictive Density (ELPD), the Multilevel Intercept Model emerged as the best-performing approach. This model achieved a 75.3% overall accuracy, with a 74.1% sensitivity and 76.3% specificity, showing good balance in identifying both diabetic and non-diabetic cases.

The hierarchical modeling structure effectively captured variations across perceived general health categories (GenHlth), offering deeper insights into how group-level effects influence diabetes risk. Key predictors identified included Age, BMI, General Health, and Cholesterol Levels, which showed strong positive associations with diabetes occurrence.

Further, the study conducted posterior predictive checks and trace diagnostics to ensure model convergence and reliability, confirming well-calibrated priors and stable inference. These diagnostics revealed no significant divergence issues, demonstrating robustness in the Bayesian framework.

In summary, the findings emphasize that Bayesian methods, through their ability to incorporate prior knowledge and quantify uncertainty, are highly effective for complex health risk prediction tasks. The probabilistic nature of these models allows for interpretable and credible inferences, making them valuable tools in medical research and decision support systems. Future work can expand on this foundation by integrating larger datasets, exploring Bayesian neural networks or decision tree models, and enhancing model complexity to improve predictive performance and clinical applicability.
