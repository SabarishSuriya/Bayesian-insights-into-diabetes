**Short Conclusion (â‰¤350 characters):** This study applied Bayesian Logistic Regression (BLR) and Multilevel Intercept Model (MIM) using BRMS to predict diabetes from BRFSS data. The MIM achieved 75.3% accuracy, identifying Age, BMI, GenHlth, and Cholesterol as key predictors. Bayesian methods proved robust for probabilistic health risk prediction.
